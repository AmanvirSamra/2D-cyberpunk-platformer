## Future Improvements
- Sound effects and music (In Progress)
- Map Builder (Partially completed - See below)
- More Enemy types and behaviours
- Heath System
- Gamepad & Voice Support

#### Running Map Builder
1. ⚠️ Currently, the map builder requires **manual editing of the code** to specify which level file to load or save.  
2. Open `editor.py` and modify the `MAP_ID` or file path variable near the top to match the level you're editing (e.g., `"data/maps/1.json"`).
3. If you're creating a new map, open the `data/maps` folder and check the highest number (e.g., `5.json`).  
   Then set the new file to the next number (e.g., `MAP_ID = 6`) to ensure it runs properly.
